  \question[10]
  Consider the vector field \(\bm F\) given by
  \[
    \bm F(x, y) = \langle y + 2xe^{y}, x^2 + x^2e^y - 2 \rangle 
    \]
  
    \begin{parts}
      \part[5] Show that the vector field \(\bm F\) is conservative.
      \vfill
      \part[10] Find a potential function \(f\) such that \( \nabla f = \bm F\)
      \vfill
      \part[5] Use part (b) to Evaluate \( \int_C \bm F \cdot d\bm r\) where \(C\) is given by the
      parametrization \( \bf{r}(t) = \langle \sqrt{t}, \ln t \rangle\) and \(
      1 \leq t \leq 4\).  (\emph{Hint:} Use the \textbf{the Fundamental Theorem of line
      integrals.} )
    \vfill
\end{parts}
\newpage
\question[10]
Use Green's theorem to evaluate the integral \( \int_C y^3 dx - x^3 dy \) where \(C\)
is the circle given by \(x^{2} + y^{2} = 4 \)

\part [5] Compute  \(\curl \bm F \)
\vfill
\part[3] Compute \( \flux{ \bm F}\)
